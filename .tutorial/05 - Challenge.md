# Challenge

Let's get you up and running with a database then!

Your challenge is to **build a simple user table** and **populate it with at least three users**.

You can use the examples in this guide for help - but take your time to experiment with the PostgreSQL tab and everything it has to offer!

Once you're done feel free to publish your work to the Replit Community or tweet about it with the hashtag `#replitPostgreSQL`. [Tag Replit](https://www.twitter.com/replit) so we can give your project some love.
