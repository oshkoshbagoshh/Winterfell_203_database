# PostgreSQL in Repls

## What is PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a simple and magical way of connecting a serverless postrgres database to any Repl. It takes a few clicks and allows you to store complex, copious amounts of data in a true relational database.

## Why do I need it?

If your data storage needs are anything more than a key-value pair, then you're going to be struggling to fit these into something like ReplDB. You need a fully featured relational database solution. That's where PostgreSQL comes in - and it's never been easier to create and connect it to your code in any Repl.
